**Control all your Docker hosts from one place.** Docker Manager MCP lets AI assistants manage containers, deploy stacks, and monitor services across your entire infrastructure - with zero configuration needed.

## üöÄ One-Line Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmagar/docker-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it! The installer:
- ‚úÖ Sets up SSH keys automatically
- ‚úÖ Imports all your existing hosts from SSH config
- ‚úÖ Configures secure authentication 
- ‚úÖ Starts the service on port 8000

**No manual configuration needed.** If you can SSH to it, Docker Manager can control it.

## üéØ What You Can Actually Do

- **Deploy applications** across multiple Docker hosts
- **Control containers** with start/stop/restart operations
- **Monitor services** with real-time log streaming
- **Manage stacks** using Docker Compose configurations
- **Update services** without downtime using rolling updates
- **Check port usage** to avoid conflicts
- **Auto-discover hosts** from your SSH configuration

## üõ† The 3 Tools

**Simply talk to your AI assistant in plain English.** No complex commands or JSON needed - just describe what you want to do with your Docker infrastructure.

### Tool 1: `docker_hosts`
Simplified Docker hosts management tool.

**Actions:**
‚Ä¢ **list**: List all configured Docker hosts
  - Required: none

‚Ä¢ **add**: Add a new Docker host (auto-runs test_connection and discover)
  - Required: host_id, ssh_host, ssh_user
  - Optional: ssh_port (default: 22), ssh_key_path, description, tags, enabled (default: true)

‚Ä¢ **ports**: List or check port usage on a host
  - Required: host_id
  - Optional: port (for availability check)

‚Ä¢ **import_ssh**: Import hosts from SSH config (auto-runs test_connection and discover for each)
  - Required: none
  - Optional: ssh_config_path, selected_hosts

‚Ä¢ **cleanup**: Docker system cleanup operations
  - Required: host_id, cleanup_type
  - Valid cleanup_type: "check" | "safe" | "moderate" | "aggressive"

‚Ä¢ **test_connection**: Test host connectivity (also runs discover)
  - Required: host_id

‚Ä¢ **discover**: Discover paths and capabilities on hosts
  - Required: host_id (use 'all' to discover all hosts sequentially)

## üèó Architecture: Why 3 Consolidated Tools?

Docker Manager MCP uses the **Consolidated Action-Parameter Pattern** instead of 27 individual tools. This architectural choice provides:

### **Token Efficiency** 
- **2.6x more efficient**: Our 3 tools use ~5k tokens vs. 27 individual tools using ~9.7k tokens
- **Better scaling**: Adding new actions to existing tools is more efficient than creating new tools
- **Context savings**: Each tool adds ~400-500 tokens - consolidation reduces this multiplicatively

### **Complex Operation Support**
Docker management requires sophisticated multi-step operations:
- **Migration**: stop ‚Üí verify ‚Üí archive ‚Üí transfer ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí validate
- **Cleanup**: analyze ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí execute ‚Üí verify
- **Deployment**: validate ‚Üí pull ‚Üí configure ‚Üí start ‚Üí health-check

### **Hybrid Connection Model** 
Different operations need different approaches:
- **Container operations**: Docker contexts (API over SSH tunnel) for efficiency
- **Stack operations**: Direct SSH (filesystem access) for compose file management

### **Service Layer Benefits**
- **Centralized validation**: Consistent input validation across all operations  
- **Error handling**: Uniform error reporting and recovery
- **Resource management**: Connection pooling, context caching, and cleanup
- **Business logic**: Complex orchestration that simple decorators can't handle

*For technical details, see [`docs/consolidated-action-pattern.md`](docs/consolidated-action-pattern.md)*

**üöÄ Advanced Migration Features:**

**Transfer Method:**
- **Rsync**: Universal compatibility for all Docker environments with compression and delta transfers

**Enhanced Safety Features:**
- **Always stops containers by default** (must explicitly skip with `skip_stop_source: true` - NOT recommended)
- **Verifies all containers are completely stopped** before archiving (prevents data corruption)
- **Archive integrity verification** before transfer
- **Filesystem sync delays** after container shutdown
- **Reliable transfers** with rsync for data consistency

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

### Deploy a WordPress Site
```yaml
# compose_content for WordPress deployment
version: '3.8'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: secret
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Use with: "Deploy wordpress stack to production-1 with this compose file"

### Monitor Multiple Hosts
Simply ask your AI assistant:
- "Show me all my Docker hosts"
- "List all containers on each host"
- "Show me the logs from nginx on production-1"
- "Stream live logs from all my database containers"

### Emergency Container Management
When things go wrong, just describe the problem:
- "Force stop all containers on production-1"
- "What's using port 80 on my staging server?"
- "Restart all my web services"
- "Show me what's currently running on production-1"

### Migrate Stack to New Host
Perfect for hardware upgrades, load balancing, or moving to faster storage:

1. **Test the migration** (dry run):
   ```
   "Do a dry run migration of wordpress from old-server to new-server"
   ```

2. **Rsync Migration** (universal compatibility):
   - **ALWAYS stops containers by default** (safety first!)
   - **Verifies all containers are completely stopped** (prevents data corruption)
   - Waits for filesystem sync to ensure data consistency
   - Archives all volumes and data (excludes cache, logs, node_modules)
   - **Verifies archive integrity** before transfer
   - Transfers via rsync with compression
   - Updates paths for the target host
   - Deploys and starts on the target
   - Preserves all your data and configurations

**The migration intelligently handles:**
- Named Docker volumes and bind mounts
- Compose configurations and environment variables
- Path translation between different host structures
- **Rsync transfer** with compression and delta synchronization
- **Data consistency** through container stopping and verification

## üîß Configuration (Optional!)

The beauty of Docker Manager MCP is that **you don't need to configure anything**. It automatically:
- Discovers your Docker hosts from SSH config
- Sets up secure connections
- Manages authentication

But if you want to customize:

### Add Custom Hosts
Create `~/.docker-mcp/config/hosts.yml`:
```yaml
hosts:
  # Production Docker Host
  production-server:
    hostname: 192.168.1.100
    user: myuser
    description: "Production Docker server"
    compose_path: /opt/compose       # Where to store compose files
    appdata_path: /opt/appdata       # Container data directory
    
  # Staging Docker Host  
  staging-server:
    hostname: 192.168.1.101
    user: myuser
    description: "Staging Docker server" 
    compose_path: /opt/compose       # Where to store compose files
    appdata_path: /opt/appdata       # Container data directory
```


### Use Environment Variables
```bash
FASTMCP_PORT=8080  # Change port
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG    # More verbose logging
```

### üöÄ Transfer Method

**Rsync Transfer Features:**
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any Linux Docker host
- **Data Integrity**: File-level verification with checksums
- **Incremental**: Delta sync with compression for efficiency
- **Metadata**: Preserves permissions, timestamps, and ownership
- **Reliable**: File-by-file transfer with retry capabilities
- **Use Case**: All Docker environments, universal compatibility

**Performance:**
- **Large datasets**: Efficient delta transfers reduce bandwidth
- **Small stacks**: Quick transfers with minimal overhead
- **Database migrations**: Container stopping ensures data consistency
